         <p>French fried potatoes are a favorite food in countries around the world. French fries do not require eating utensils in informal situations, which makes them easy to eat and to carry away from the point of purchase. </p>
          <h4 align ='left'>RECIPE</h4>
          <ul  align ='left'>
            <li>Peel and rinse the potatoes. Then cut them into sticks by cutting the potato in 4 or 5 vertical pieces, and then cutting each piece into sticks. </li>
            <li>Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak, 2 to 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight.) </li>
            <li>When you're ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry them. </li>
            <li>Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot to 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. They should not be brown at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain on new/dry paper towels. </li>
            <li>Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil's hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp. Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with sea salt and dive in!</li>

         <p> Pizza is a savoury dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
          <h4 align ='left'>RECIPE</h4>
          <ul  align ='left'>
            <li>To prepare this delicious Cheese Pizza recipe, preheat the oven on convection mode at 250 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, spread the tomato sauce evenly on each pizza base. Take a chopping board and chop onions, tomatoes, capsicum and mushroom on it.
            </li>
            <li>Mix all the chopped vegetables and seasoning in a bowl. Microwave these vegetables in a microwave safe bowl for around 30-40 seconds. Spread this vegetable topping on each pizza base. Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese at the top of each pizza.</li>
            <li>You can either bake this pizza in a microwave or you can use a non-stick tawa for the same. However, in this recipe we have used microwave. Bake the pizza on the high rack at 250 degree Celsius till the cheese melts. It will take around 10-12 minutes. Cut the delicious Cheese Pizza into slices and serve with sauces.</li>
